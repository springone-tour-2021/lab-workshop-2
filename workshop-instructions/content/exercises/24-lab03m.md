Now you are ready to deploy the Color Application to Kubernetes.

To `watch` the deployment as it happens, run the following command.
> Note: The command will execute in Terminal 2.
> Initially you will see the output: `No resources found in springone-tour-lab-workshop-2-w01-s001 namespace.`
> Let the command continue to run and proceed to the next action block.
> The output in Terminal 2 will change as the deployment progresses.
```execute-2
watch -n 1 kubectl get all
```

To deploy everything to Kubernetes run the following command

```execute-1
kubectl apply -Rf ~/color-app/k8s
```

Wait until `STATUS=Ready` and `READY=1/1` for all pods. Then, click the action button below to open the Auth Gateway in your browser and test the application.
You should be able to log in with the user `user` and the password `pw` and only see the colors blue, green, or red (for the slowgreen service.)

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}
```

Now log out by going to

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}/logout
```

Then log back in with the user `premium` and the password `pw`.
Now in addition to the colors you saw with the user `user` you should see the color yellow.

Exit the watch command by running the following action command.

```terminal:interrupt
session: 2
```

## Next Steps
You are ready to begin the third and last lab of this workshop: re-deploy the application to Kubernetes without Spring Cloud Kubernetes.
