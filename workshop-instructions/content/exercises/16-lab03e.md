Spring Boot maven plugin is just one of several tools that support Cloud Native Buildpacks.
Another example is a CLI called `pack`.

Spring Boot's maven and gradle plugins can be used to build applications built on Spring Boot 2.3.0 and above.
For other Java applications, and for applications written in other languages such as Python, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, etc, you can use other tools.
One example is a CLI called `pack`.

We do not need to rebuild our images.
However, we can still use `pack` to leverage other features of CNB that are not available through the Spring Boot plugins.

For example, you can use `pack image inspect` to get information about an image, such as the base images and buildpacks used to create it.
```execute-1
pack inspect blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

You can add a `--bom` ("bill of materials") flag to get more detailed information about the contents of the image, including - in this case - versions of the JRE and of all the Java dependencies.
```execute-1
pack inspect blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT --bom
```

Another neat inspection tool that works on any image, not just CNB-built images, is `dive`.
This tool shows the contents of each layer of the image.
```execute-1
dive blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

After running the command above, click on Terminal 1 and use your keyboard to type: `Tab`, `Ctrl-U`, `Tab`

The `Tab` button is used to switch between the Layer and Filetree views.
`Ctrl-U` is used in the Filetree view to hide/show unmodified files.

Use the down arrow to move down the list of layers on the left frame until you see the layers that have the dependencies (.jar files in `/workspace/BOOT-INF/lib`) and the app code (.class, .yml, etc files in `/workspace/BOOT-INF/classes`) on the right frame.

Notice that there is no single fat jar.
Rather, the Java application was exploded.
This is an optimization to achieve faster startup time.
Notice also that the exploded files are organized into multiple layers, separating files that change infrequently (e.g. Spring Boot base libraries) from files that change more frequently (e.g. your code).
The layer that is most likely to change (application-specific .class files) is now kilobytes rather than megabytes.
This makes it faster to rebuild images and publish images updates to container registries.

The precise intelligence for building the OCI image, including the optimizations above as well as others, don't come from the CNB project itself.
Rather, they come from the set of Buildpacks that Spring Boot is using by default.
These are the Paketo Buildpacks.

Exit `dive`.
```execute-1
<ctrl+c>
```
