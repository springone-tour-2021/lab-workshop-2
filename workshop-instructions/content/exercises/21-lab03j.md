The file `blueorgreen-deployment.template` will act as a template for creating deployment manifests for the various Color Apps.
We need to template this deployment manifest in two places:

1. The name of the deployment
2. The Spring Boot profile to activate

## Template Deployment Name
Execute the following `sed` command to replace the `metadata.name` property in the manifest with the template `$COLOR`.

```execute-1
sed -i '0,/name: blueorgreen/{s/name: blueorgreen/name: $COLOR/}' k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
```

Examine the resulting file.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
```

## Template Spring Boot Active Profiles
To activate the Spring Boot profile for the color you can set the environment variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` in the container when it starts on Kubernetes.
> Note: Recall that in a previous step you defined the ConfigMap for `blueorgreen.yml` as `application-blueorgreen.yml`.
> To ensure Spring Boot processes this file, you need to add `blueorgreen` to the list of active profiles.

Add the following templated environment variable to the manifest to set the active profiles.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.spec.containers[0]
value:
    env:
    - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
      value: blueorgreen,$COLOR
```

## Template Premium/Nonpremium Hints
Add a label to the deployments called `hint` indicating whether a service is premium.
This will also need to be templated so that it can be set differently for different color instances.
> Note: You will use this hint when creating the Kubernetes Services in the next step.
> 
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: metadata.labels
value:
    hint: $TYPE
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.selector.matchLabels
value:
    hint: $TYPE
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.metadata.labels
value:
    hint: $TYPE
```

## Generate Deployment Manifests From Template
Now we can substitute the variables in this template using the `envsubst` command line
utility and generate deployment manifests for each of the Color Apps.

```execute-1
COLOR=blue
TYPE=nonpremium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/blue-deployment.yaml

COLOR=green
TYPE=nonpremium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/green-deployment.yaml

COLOR=yellow
TYPE=premium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/yellow-deployment.yaml

COLOR=slowgreen
TYPE=nonpremium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/slowgreen-deployment.yaml
```

List the deployment manifest files you have created.
```execute-1
ls -l k8s/ | grep deployment.yaml
```

The output will look like this.
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1028 May 11 19:13 authgateway-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1276 May 11 19:14 blue-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1032 May 11 19:13 frontend-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1026 May 11 19:13 gateway-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1278 May 11 19:14 green-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1286 May 11 19:14 slowgreen-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 1271 May 11 19:14 yellow-deployment.yaml
```

Take a moment to review one of the files created.
For example, in the following file, $COLOR was replace by blue, an $TYPE was replaced by nonpremium.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blue-deployment.yaml
```
