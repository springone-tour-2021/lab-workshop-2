## Publish Images To Registry

In order to deploy these images to Kubernetes, Kubernetes must be able to "pull" them.
Kubernetes cannot access them from the local Docker daemon.
It can, however, pull them from a container registry that is network-accessible.

A local private container registry is available in this workshop environment.
For convenience, its address is saved in an environment variable.
You can see it by running the following command.
```execute-1
echo $REGISTRY_HOST
```

Publish the images to the container registry.
```execute-1
docker tag blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice

docker tag blueorgreenfrontend:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend

docker tag blueorgreengateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway

docker tag authgateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
```

You can use a CLI called [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to verify that the containers are in the registry.
For example, check for the Backend container:
```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
```
