##### Externalized Configuration
Upon startup, each app communicates with the Config Server to obtain its respective configuration.
The Config Server retrieves all configuration files from the [`config-files` directory on GitHub](https://github.com/springone-tour-2021/gateway-s1p-2018/tree/master/config-files).
 How does the Config Server know where to get the full set of config files?
 You can see this in the Config Server's properties file:
 ```editor:select-matching-text
 file: ~/color-app/configserver.yml
 text: uri
 before: 1
 after: 1
 ```

The Config Server then uses each app's `spring.application.name` and its profile (e.g. `blue`) to filter the appropriate set of configuration parameters for a given app instance.
For example, for the `blue` app, `spring.application.name=blueorgreen` and `profiles=blue`, so the configuration is created using an overlay of the following files: `config-files/application.yml` and parts of `config-files/blueorgreen.yml`.
You can peruse the files locally since they are included in the cloned repo.
Use the left-hand frame in the Editor to switch between files.
 ```editor:select-matching-text
 file: ~/color-app/config-files/blueorgreen.yml
 text: blue
 before: 0
 after: 2
 ```
