Test the app by opening the Auth Gateway endpoint in the browser.
```dashboard:open-url
url: http://{{ session_namespace }}-authgateway.{{ ingress_domain }}/
```

Notice that you are automatically routed to a login page.

Log in using username `user` and password `pw`.

After logging in, refresh the page several times.
You should see the color rotate between blue, green, and red.
You should **not** see yellow.

Where is the red coming from?
Notice that green never takes 5 seconds to appear.
Instead, each time `slowgreen` is called, the color red appears after only a 1-second delay.

Log out of the application by typing `/logout` at the end of the URL or by clicking on the following action block:
```dashboard:open-url
url: http://{{ session_namespace }}-authgateway.{{ ingress_domain }}/logout
```

Log in again using username `premium` and password `pw`.
Refresh the page several times.
You should now see yellow amongst the colors.
