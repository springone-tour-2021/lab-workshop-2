Stop all the locally running applications.
```execute-1
kill $(pidof java)
```

## Summary
In the previous exercise, you deployed and tested the Color Application locally at your terminal.

You should now have a good understanding of how the app works and of the expected behavior.

## Next Steps
You are ready to begin the second lab of this workshop: deploy the application to Kubernetes.
