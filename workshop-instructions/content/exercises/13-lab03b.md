## Plan Kubernetes Configuration
As you saw in the previous exercise, instances reported a hint to Eureka to indicate if they were `premium` or `nonpremium`, so we had this information on a per-instance basis, as shown below:

With Eureka:
- blueorgreen-app
  - blue (hint: nonpremium)
  - green (hint: nonpremium)
  - slowgreen (hint: nonpremium)
  - yellow (hint: premium)

With Kubernetes, we don't have this luxury, the metadata belongs to the `Service` so we can't define it on a per-instance (pod) basis:

On Kubernetes:
- blueorgreen-service (hint: premium or nonpremium?)
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

How can we differentiate between premium and nonpremium instances on Kubernetes?
One approach it so define the difference at the `Service` level, as follows:

On Kubernetes, with multiple Services:
- blueorgreen-nonpremium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
- blueorgreen-premium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

In order to route requests across the two Services, you need to modify the routing configuration in the Routing Gateway such that, if the incoming request belongs to a non-premium user, it is routed to the `blueorgreen-nonpremium` `Service`, and if the request belongs to a premium user, it is routed to the `blueorgreen-premium`.

## Update Routing Gateway

Notice the route definition in the Routing Gateway app for routing requests to the color instances:
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: '.route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")'
before: 0
after: 2
```

Replace this route definition with a different definition that distinguishes between premium and non-premium destinations.
First, remove the existing route definition.
```execute-1
sed -i '29,31d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Notice the routes are now removed.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: 'return builder.routes()'
before: 0
after: 2
```

Then paste in the new route definitions.

```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java

                .route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")
                        .and().header("X-SC-LB-Hint", "nonpremium")
                        .filters(this::circuitBreaker)
                        .uri("lb://blueorgreen-nonpremium"))
                .route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")
                        .filters(this::circuitBreaker)
                        .uri("lb://blueorgreen-premium"))
```

The Routing Gateway will now be able to route requests appropriately without the help of Eureka hints.
