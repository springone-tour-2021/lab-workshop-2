In order to deploy these images to Kubernetes, Kubernetes must be able to "pull" them.
Kubernetes cannot access them from the local Docker daemon.
It can, however, pull them from a container registry that is network-accessible.

A local private container registry is available in this workshop environment.
For convenience, its address is saved in an environment variable.
You can see it by running the following command.
```execute-1
echo $REGISTRY_HOST
```

Publish the images to the container registry.
> Note: To speed up the publishing of images, you can execute the following two action blocks concurrently.
> The action blocks will run in different terminal windows.
```execute-1
docker tag blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice

docker tag blueorgreenfrontend:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
```

```execute-2
docker tag blueorgreengateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway

docker tag authgateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
```

You can use a CLI called [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to verify that the containers are in the registry.
For example, check for the Backend container:
```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
```
