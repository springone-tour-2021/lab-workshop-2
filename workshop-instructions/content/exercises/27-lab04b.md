The Frontend, Auth Gateway, and Routing Gateway apps use Spring load balanced routes and Rest templates to load balance requests across endpoints.
On Kubernetes, this is redundant since Kubernetes Services provide load balancing across pods.

The Auth Gateway uses the `lb` protocol.
Use the following action button to view the line where it is used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://"
```

Replace the `lb` protocol with `http`.

```editor:replace-text-selection
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
text: "http://"
```

The Frontend uses a `@LoadBalanced` `RestTemplate`.
Use the following action button to view the line where it is used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/BlueOrGreenFrontendApplication.java
text: "@LoadBalanced"
```

Execute the following command to remove the `@LoadBalanced` annotation.

```editor:replace-text-selection
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/BlueOrGreenFrontendApplication.java
text: ""
```

The Routing Gateway also uses load balanced routes.
Use the following action buttons to view the lines where they are used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreen-nonpremium"
```

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreen-premium"
```

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreenfrontend"
```

Execute the following command in the Terminal window to replace the three instances of `lb` protocol with `http`.

```execute-1
sed -i s/lb:/http:/g ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Review the file in the Editor tab to validate that the protocol was updated in all three locations.

```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

In addition, Auth Gateway uses a `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation that is no longer needed.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: @LoadBalancerClient
before: 0
after: 0
```

Execute the following command to remove the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation.

```editor:replace-text-selection
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: ""
```

Since you no longer need any load balancer client configuration you can also remove the `LoadBalancerConfiguration.java` file entirely.

```execute-1
rm ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/LoadBalancerConfiguration.java
```
