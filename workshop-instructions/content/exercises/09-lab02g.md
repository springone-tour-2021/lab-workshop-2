## Service Discovery & Premium Configuration

For app-to-app communication, when an app needs to make an HTTP request to another app it uses Eureka to look up the endpoint of the destination app.

When the Routing Gateway looks up the Backend instances, it also checks for extra metadata.
Specifically, it checks for metadata indicating if the service is `premium` or `nonpremium`.
Take a look at the `blueorgreen.yml` that should be open in your Editor from the previous action block.
Notice the default configuration property at the top of the file: `eureka.instance.metadataMap.hint: nonpremium`.
Also notice that the yellow instance sets the value to `premium`.

You can verify that this metadata gets registered in Eureka using the following command, which retrieves details on all instances, and then filters the results using the key word `premium`.
Notice that only the instance running on port 8282 (yellow) contains metadata containing the `premium` key word.

```execute-1
http -b :8761/eureka/apps | grep -B 2 -A 2 "<hint>premium</hint>"
```

Your output will look like this.
```xml
      <metadata>
        <instanceId>blueorgreen:8282</instanceId>
        <hint>premium</hint>
        <management.port>8282</management.port>
      </metadata>
```

The Routing Gateway uses the authorization information in the request header (added by the Auth Gateway) together with this metadata obtained from Eureka to determine whether to include the yellow endpoint in the load balancing for a given request user.
