The Color Application represents a "heritage" application - an existing application that is presumably running in production and is satisfying business needs.
However, managing the application at scale on traditional infrastructure can be cumbersome.
The company is modernizing infrastructure, and operational benefit can be gained from running the application on Kubernetes.

Over the following few sections, you will move the Color Application to Kubernetes. You will deploy only the four Color Application apps to Kubernetes, but not Eureka or Config Server.

* Add Spring Cloud Kubernetes
* Refactor Premium Service Routing
* Build Container Images
* Publish Images To Registry
* Inspect Images (OPTIONAL)
* Create Deployment Manifests  
* Mount Configuration - Frontend and Gateway Apps
* Mount Configuration - Backend
* Add Liveness & Readiness Probes
* Template The Backend Deployment
* Create Service Manifests
* Create An Ingress For The Auth Gateway
* Deploy And Test The Applications
