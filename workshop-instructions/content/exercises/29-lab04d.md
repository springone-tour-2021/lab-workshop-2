You can open the Auth Gateway and test out the premium and non-premium use cases.

Premium username: `premium`
Premium password: `pw`

Non-premium username: `user`
Non-premium password: `pw`

Use the following action button to open the Auth Gateway in your browser.

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}
```

You can use the following action button to log out.

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}/logout
```

If you refresh the app in your browser you will likely see the same color returned every time you refresh.

Load balancing is very "sticky" with Kubernetes services.
If you make a lot of requests, you will eventually notice the load balancing.
An easy way to demonstrate this is to run a script that generates many requests.

Execute the following command to `port-forward` requests from the "local" 8080 port to the 8080 port of `blueorgreengateway`.

```execute-2
kubectl port-forward deployments/blueorgreengateway 8080:8080
```

Once you see that the process started forwarding the traffic, run the following command to make several hundred requests to the Routing Gateway.
Observe the colors returned.

 ```execute-1
 x=1; while [ $x -le 500 ]; do curl localhost:8080/blueorgreen; (( x++ )); done
 ```
As this runs, you should see the color change every so often.

Exit the `port-forward` process.
```execute-2
<ctrl+c>
```
