Recall that in a previous step, you added configuration to the common `application.yml` file for Kubernetes deployments.
Review the file now.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/config-files/application.yml
text: "on-cloud-platform"
before: 3
after: 11
```

To maintain this configuration file external to the apps as in the original project setup, you can mount it as a ConfigMap. Spring Boot will then be able to access the file via a local path process it as it would on a local deployment.

Create a ConfigMap from the common `application.yml` file.
```execute-1
kubectl create configmap application-config \
        --from-file=config-files/application.yml \
        -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/application-configmap.yaml
```

Review the resulting file.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/k8s/application-configmap.yaml
```

Update each Deployment manifest in order to mount the ConfigMap as a volume mount on the app container.

Start with the Auth Gateway deployment manifest.

Review the existing file.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/k8s/authgateway-deployment.yaml
```

Create a volume.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/authgateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: application-config
```

Mount the volume on the container.
> Note: If you mount the volume at `/workspace/config/`, for example, Spring Boot will find this configuration by default and load it as usual.
> This is because Cloud Native Buildpacks places the app files in the `/workspace` directory in the image, and Spring Boot looks in `./config` for configuration files by default.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/authgateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```

Do the same for the Routing Gateway and Frontend.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/gateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: application-config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/gateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: application-config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```

For the above three apps, you only need to mount the `application.yml` file configuration.
The app-specific config files were used only to set unique ports, which is not necessary on Kubernetes.

For the Backend, however, you do need to mount the application-specific config file as well.

In the next step, you will mount configuration for the Backend app.
