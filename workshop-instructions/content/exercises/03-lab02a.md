The applications are configured to connect to a Spring Cloud Config Server and a Eureka Discovery Server running locally in order to retrieve their configuration and find one another.

Use the [Spring Cloud CLI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-cli) to start an instance of each.
> Note: The following startup commands will run the Java processes in the background, so you won't see the app startup log appear in the terminal window.
> Instead, any logging will be redirected to a file.
```execute-1
mkdir -p logs
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-Xms64M -Xmx64M' spring cloud configserver eureka > logs/run-spring-cloud.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
```

Run the following command repeatedly until you see output confirming that Config Server and Eureka have started.
> Note: To see the whole log, you can delete the second portion of the command, starting with the pipe character ("|").
```execute-1
cat logs/run-spring-cloud.log | grep "started on port"
```

The output should look like this, indicating Config Server listening on port 8888 and Eureka listening on port 8761.

```

Once Eureka has started, you can access its dashboard.
> Note: Leave the Eureka dashboard open in your browser.
> You will refer back to it in the following steps.
```dashboard:open-url
url: http://{{ session_namespace }}-eureka.{{ ingress_domain }}/
```
