Spring Cloud provides nice abstractions around things like load balancing, service discovery, and configuration that allows you to run your applications on multiple cloud platforms with little to no changes of the code base.

If, however, you have determined you only want to deploy your applications to Kubernetes and don't want or need the abstractions, you can rely on the cloud native features of Kubernetes directly in which case you can remove Spring Cloud Kubernetes from your applications.

Over the following few sections, you will re-deploy the Color Application to Kubernetes using Kubernetes directly for service discovery and load balancing, including:

* Remove Spring Cloud Kubernetes Dependencies
* Remove Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
* Rebuild and Redeploy 
* Test The Applications
