## The Color Application
Throughout this workshop, you will be using an application that displays colors.
Each time the end user refreshes the page in a browser, a different color is displayed.

The application comprises the following Spring Boot apps:
- Auth Gateway App - Intercepts all requests and ensures the user is authenticated; if the user is not authenticated, it redirects the request to a login page.
- Routing Gateway App - Intercepts all authenticated requests and forwards them to the proper Spring Boot app; requests generated by end users are forwarded to the Frontend app, while requests generated by the Frontend app (JavaScript) are forwarded to a Backend app.
- Frontend App - Produces the HTML and JavaScript that will be served to the end user.
- Backend App - Returns a particular color; four instances of this app will be started: blue, green, "slow" green, and yellow.

The application also leverages a Discovery Server (based on Netflix Eureka) so that the apps can find one another's endpoints, as well as a Config Server to serve each app its respective configuration from a central location (the `config-files` directory in the same code repository).

## Download The Source Code

Start by cloning the application:
```execute-1
git clone https://github.com/springone-tour-2021/gateway-s1p-2018.git color-app
```

Navigate into the cloned directory in both terminal windows.
```execute-all
cd color-app
```

List the directories in the repository.
```execute-1
ls -ld */
```

Your output will show a directory per app listed above, as well as a `config-files` directory with configuration files for all apps.
Compare the directory listing to the application overview above (_hint:_ blueorgreengateway is the Routing Gateway and blueorgreenservice is the Backend service).

## Next Steps
You are ready to begin the first lab of this workshop: run the application locally.
