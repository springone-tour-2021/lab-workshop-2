Now that you have built and published the application images, you can attempt to deploy them to Kubernetes.
Each image will be deployed using a Kubernetes `deployment` resource.
The deployment creates one or more pods, each with a running instance of the image (aka a container) of the corresponding application.
Each app will also need a Kubernetes `service` resource, which will load balance requests across all instances of a particular pod.
The deployment and service resources will be defined declaratively using manifests (yaml files).

## Create Deployment Manifests

First, create the manifest for the `deployment` for the Frontend, Routing Gateway, and Auth Gateway.
Use the `kubectl` CLI with the option `--dry-run=client` to generate the yaml without applying it to Kubernetes.
```execute-1
mkdir -p k8s

kubectl create deployment blueorgreenfrontend \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend \
            -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml

kubectl create deployment blueorgreengateway \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway \
            -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/gateway-deployment.yaml

kubectl create deployment blueorgreenauthgateway \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway \
            -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/authgateway-deployment.yaml
```

## Create Deployment Manifest Template for Backend
Next, create the manifest for the `deployment` for the Backend. The command is exactly the same as the above commands, but in this you are saving the output of the command to a file with extension `.template` instead of `.yaml`. You will be converting this into 4 color-specific `yaml` files later in this exercise.
```execute-1
kubectl create deployment blueorgreen \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice \
            -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
```

List all of the files you just created.
```execute-1
ls -l k8s/
```

Your output should look like this.
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 539 May  7 01:47 authgateway-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 509 May  7 01:47 blueorgreen-deployment.template
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 543 May  7 01:47 frontend-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 eduk8s root 537 May  7 01:47 gateway-deployment.yaml
```
