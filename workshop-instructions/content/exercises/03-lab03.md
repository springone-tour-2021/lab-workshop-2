# Deploy Color Application To Kubernetes - Step 1

The Color Application represents a "heritage" application - an existing application that is presumably running in production and is satisfying business needs.
However, the company is modernizing infrastructure, and operational benefit can be gained from running the application on Kubernetes.

In this exercise, you will move the Color Application to Kubernetes. You will deploy only the four Color Application apps to Kubernetes, but not Eureka or Config Server.

## Spring Cloud Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Kubernetes is a great way to bridge some of the differences between Spring Cloud and Kubernetes without having to make changes to your code.

In this exercise, 

Instead, you will use Spring Cloud Kubernetes to resolve service names and load balance requests.
In this exercise, in lieu of the Config Server, you will use Spring Boot support for ConfigMaps.

Add Spring Cloud Kubernetes starters for discovery and load balancing to the pom.xml files for the Auth Gateway, Routing Gateway, and Frontend.

```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/pom.xml

text: |
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```

match: 	<dependencies>
text: |
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```

```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/pom.xml
match: 	<dependencies>
text: |
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```

To preserve local functionality with Eureka and Config Server and also support Kubernetes integration, you can use configuration to enable or disable Spring Cloud Kubernetes, as appropriate.
The following commands will add the necessary enable/disable configuration to the `application.yml` files for all of our apps.

In the common `application.yml` that is shared by all of the apps, disable Spring Cloud Kubernetes by default.
This will preserve the original behavior when the app is run locally.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/config-files/application.yml
path: spring
value:
    cloud:
      kubernetes:
        discovery:
          enabled: false
        enabled: false
```

In the same file, add a second YAML document to enable Spring Cloud Kubernetes for Kubernetes deployments and disable Spring Cloud Config client.
We can do this easily by leveraging `spring.config.activate.on-platform` property to apply specific configuration
for Kubernetes.
```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/color-app/config-files/application.yml
text: |
        ---
        spring:
          config:
            activate:
              on-cloud-platform: "kubernetes"
          cloud:
            kubernetes:
              discovery:
                enabled: true
              enabled: true
        eureka:
          client:
            enabled: false
```

## Premium Service Configuration

As you saw in the previous exercise, instances reported a hint to Eureka to indicate if they were `premium` or `nonpremium`, so we had this information on a per-instance basis.
With Kubernetes, we don't have this luxury, the metadata belongs to the `Service` so we can't define it on a per-instance (pod) basis.
Rather, we need to define it on a per-`Service` basis:

Eureka:
- blueorgreen-app
  - blue (hint: nonpremium)
  - green (hint: nonpremium)
  - slowgreen (hint: nonpremium)
  - yellow (hint: premium)

Kubernetes:
- blueorgreen-service (hint: premium or nonpremium?)
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

In order to resolve this, we can create two `Service`s in Kubernetes, one for `premium` (`blueorgreen-premium`) and one for `nonpremium` (`blueorgreen-nonpremium`) users:

- blueorgreen-nonpremium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
- blueorgreen-premium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

This way, we can modify the routing configuration in gateway and if the incoming request belongs to a non-premium user, we can route it to the `blueorgreen-nonpremium` `Service`.
Similarly, if the request belongs to a premium user, we can route it to `blueorgreen-premium`. 
(If you indent the code appropriately in the editor, you will see the diff about the changes.)

Notice the route definition in the Routing Gateway app for routing requests to the color instances:
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: '.route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")'
before: 0
after: 2
```

Replace this route definition with a different definition that distinguishes between premium and non-premium destinations.
First, remove the existing route definition.
```execute-1
sed -i '29,31d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Then paste in the new route definitions.
```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
line: 29
text: |
                .route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")
                        .and().header("X-SC-LB-Hint", "nonpremium")
                        .filters(this::circuitBreaker)
                        .uri("lb://blueorgreen-nonpremium"))
                .route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")
                        .filters(this::circuitBreaker)
                        .uri("lb://blueorgreen-premium"))
```

The Routing Gateway will now be able to route requests appropriately without the help of Eureka hints.

## Container Images

The next step is to package the applications as container images.

The apps cannot be deployed as plain .class or .jar files on Kubernetes.
Instead, each application, along with all of its dependencies - including all Spring and other supporting libraries, the JRE, and the OS filesystem itself - must be packaged into a bundle that adheres to a standard format (Docker or OCI, which stands for Open Container Initiative).
The container image is, hence, a standardized, complete, self-contained, immutable, executable bundle.

Container images provide operational simplicity because they alleviate the burden of having to prepare or maintain dependencies on the target runtime environment.
They make applications easily portable across any runtime that supports Docker or OCI images, and they enable any configuration, such as environment variables, that should be constant across environments to be packaged into the application, hence providing opportunities to better secure the application.

There are several ways to build container images.
In this exercise, you will use Cloud Native Buildpacks to generate an OCI image for each app.

Cloud Native Buildpacks (_CNB_, or _buildpacks_, for short) provides a standalone, standardized way to build OCI images.
The images can then be published to any OCI-compliant container registry (e.g. Docker Hub, Harbor, etc...) and run on any OCI-compliant runtime platform (e.g. Kubernetes).

Spring Boot's maven plugin has built-in support for CNB through the `build-image` goal.

Build an image for each of the four Color Application apps.
```execute-1
cd blueorgreenservice && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
cd blueorgreenfrontend && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
cd blueorgreengateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
cd authgateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
```

When the above commands have completed, list the images in your local Docker daemon.
```execute-1
docker images
```

Your output will look like this.
```
[~/color-app]$  docker images
REPOSITORY                 TAG              IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
paketobuildpacks/run       base-cnb         ec1ea152d2be   2 weeks ago    92.1MB
paketobuildpacks/builder   base             de6226937194   41 years ago   663MB
blueorgreen                0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   356e122ba24b   41 years ago   286MB
blueorgreenfrontend        0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   a566344355a2   41 years ago   317MB
blueorgreengateway         0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   de729135b96b   41 years ago   320MB
authgateway                0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   3c80da733204   41 years ago   321MB
```

## Publish Images To Registry

In order to deploy these images to Kubernetes, Kubernetes must be able to "pull" them.
Kubernetes cannot access them from the local Docker daemon.
It can, however, pull them from a container registry that is network-accessible.

A local private container registry is available in this workshop environment.
For convenience, its address is saved in an environment variable.
You can see it by running the following command.
```execute-1
echo $REGISTRY_HOST
```

Publish the images to the container registry.
```execute-1
docker tag blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice

docker tag blueorgreenfrontend:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend

docker tag blueorgreengateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway

docker tag authgateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
```

You can use a CLI called [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to verify that the containers are in the registry.
For example, check for the Backend container:
```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
```

## OPTIONAL: Inspect Images

Spring Boot maven plugin is just one of several tools that support Cloud Native Buildpacks.
Another example is a CLI called `pack`.

Spring Boot's maven and gradle plugins can be used to build applications built on Spring Boot 2.3.0 and above.
For other Java applications, and for applications written in other languages such as Python, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, etc, you can use other tools.
One example is a CLI called `pack`.

We do not need to rebuild our images.
However, we can still use `pack` to leverage other features of CNB that are not available through the Spring Boot plugins.

For example, you can use `pack image inspect` to get information about an image, such as the base images and buildpacks used to create it.
```execute-1
pack inspect blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

You can add a `--bom` ("bill of materials") flag to get more detailed information about the contents of the image, including - in this case - versions of the JRE and of all the Java dependencies.
```execute-1
pack inspect blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT --bom
```

Another neat inspection tool that works on any image, not just CNB-built images, is `dive`.
This tool shows the contents of each layer of the image.
```execute-1
dive blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

After running the command above use your keyboard to type: `Tab`, `Ctrl-U`, `Tab`

The `Tab` button is used to switch between the Layer and Filetree views.
`Ctrl-U` is used in the Filetree view to hide/show unmodified files.

Use the down arrow to move down the list of layers on the left frame until you see the layers that have the dependencies (.jar files) and the app code (.class, .yml, etc files) on the right frame.

> Picture for reference of dependencies:
![alt_text](images/dive-cnb-libs.png "find workspace after tab, ctrl-u, tab")


> Picture for reference of application-specific files:
![alt_text](images/dive-cnb-classes.png "find workspace after tab, ctrl-u, tab")

Notice that there is no single fat jar.
Rather, the Java application was exploded.
This is an optimization to achieve faster startup time.
Notice also that the exploded files are organized into multiple layers, separating files that change infrequently (e.g. Spring Boot base libraries) from files that change more frequently (e.g. your code).
The layer that is most likely to change (application-specific .class files) is now kilobytes rather than megabytes.
This makes it faster to rebuild images and publish images updates to container registries.

The precise intelligence for building the OCI image, including the optimizations above as well as others, don't come from the CNB project itself.
Rather, they come from the set of Buildpacks that Spring Boot is using by default.
These are the Paketo Buildpacks.
You can learn more about the Paketo Java Buildpack [here](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/java).

Exit `dive`.
```execute-1
<ctrl+c>
```
