# Lift & Shift the Color Application to Kubernetes - Step 1

The color application represents a "heritage" application - an existing application that is presumably running in production and is satisfying business needs. 
However, the company is modernizing infrastructure, and operational benefit can be gained from running the application on Kubernetes.

Throughout the following exercises, you will "lift and shift" the color application to Kubernetes, with minimal changes. 

## Spring Cloud Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Kubernetes is a great way to bridge some of the differences between Spring Cloud and Kubernetes without having to make changes to your code.

Start by adding the Spring Cloud Kubernetes starter to each of the Color Application `pom.xml` files.
You can skip Config Server and Eureka Server, as you won't be needing these on Kubernetes. Instead, Spring Cloud Kubernetes will resolve service names to Kubernetes Services, an it will load application properties from Kubernetes ConfigMaps.

Start with the Auth Gateway.
Open the `pom.xml`.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/pom.xml
```

```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/pom.xml
match: 	<dependencies>
text: |
    		<dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
            </dependency>
```

Do the same for the Routing Gateway, the Frontend, and the Color Service.
```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/pom.xml
match: 	<dependencies>
text: |
    		<dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
            </dependency>
```

```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/pom.xml

    		<dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>

            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
            </dependency>
```

```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenservice/pom.xml
match: 	<dependencies>
text: |
    		<dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-loadbalancer</artifactId>
            </dependency>
```

To preserve local functionality with Eureka and Config Server and also support Kubernetes integration for Kubernetes deployments, you can use configuration to enable or disable Spring Cloud Kubernetes, as appropriate.
By default we disable Spring Cloud Kubernetes.  When the apps are deployed on Kubernetes
we want to enable Spring Cloud Kubernetes.  We can do this easily by leveraging
`spring.config.activate.on-platform` property to apply specific configuration
for Kubernetes.  The following commands will add the necessary enable/disable
configuration to the `application.yml` files for all of our apps.

Adding metadata to a Kubernetes `Service` works a little differently than adding metadata to application instances in Eureka. As you saw in the previous exercise, instances were reporting a hint if they are `premium` or `nonpremium` to Eureka, so we had this information on a per-instance basis. With Kubernetes, we don't have this luxury, the metadata belongs to the `Service` so we can't define it on a per-instance (pod) basis, we need to define it on a per-`Service` basis:

Eureka:
- blueorgreen-app
  - blue (hint: nonpremium)
  - green (hint: nonpremium)
  - slowgreen (hint: nonpremium)
  - yellow (hint: premium)

Kubernetes:
- blueorgreen-service (hint: premium or nonpremium?)
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

In order to resolve this, we can create two `Service`s in Kubernetes, one for `premium` (`blueorgreen-premium`) and one for `nonpremium` (`blueorgreen-nonpremium`) users:

- blueorgreen-nonpremium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
- blueorgreen-premium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

This way, we can modify the routing configuration in gateway and if the incoming request belongs to a non-premium user, we can route it to the `blueorgreen-nonpremium` `Service`. Similarly, if the request belongs to a premium user, we can route it to `blueorgreen-premium`.  
(If you indent the code appropriately in the editor, you will see the diff about the changes.)

	}
```

## Container images

The next step is to package the applications as container images.

The apps cannot be deployed as plain .class or .jar files on Kubernetes. 
Instead, each application, along with all of its dependencies - including all Spring and other supporting libraries, the JRE, and the OS filesystem itself - must be packaged into a bundle that adheres to a standard format (Docker or OCI, which stands for Open Container Initiative). 
The container image is, hence, a standardized, complete, self-contained, executable bundle. 
It is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed. 
Container images provide operational simplicity because they alleviate the burden of having to prepare or maintain dependencies on the target runtime environment. 
They make applications easily portable across any runtime that supports Docker or OCI images, and they enable any configuration, such as environment variables, that should be constant across environments to be packaged into the application, hence providing opportunities to better secure the application.

There are several ways to build container images. In this exercise, you will use Cloud Native Buildpacks to generate an OCI image for each app.

Cloud Native Buildpacks (_CNB_, or _buildpacks_, for short) provides a standalone, standardized way to build OCI images. The images can then be published to any OCI-compliant container registry (e.g. Docker Hub, Harbor, etc...) and run on any OCI-compliant runtime platform (e.g. Kubernetes).

Spring Boot's maven plugin has built-in support for CNB through the `build-image` goal.

Build an image for the `blueorgreenservice`. 
```execute-2
cd blueorgreenservice && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
```

List the images you have created so far:
```execute-1
docker images | grep SNAPSHOT
```

Your output will look like this.
```
blueorgreen                0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   cf9a8a4ece64   41 years ago   317MB
```

## OPTIONAL: Using `pack` to inspect images

Spring Boot maven plugin is just one of several tools that support Cloud Native Buildpacks.
Another example is a CLI called `pack`.

Spring Boot's maven and gradle plugins can be used to build applications built on Spring Boot 2.3.0 and above. For other Java applications, and for applications written in other languages such as Python, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, etc, you can use other tools. One example is a CLI called `pack`. 

We do not need to rebuild our images. However, wew can still use `pack` to leverage other features of CNB that are not available through the Spring Boot plugins.

For example, you can use `pack image inspect` to get information about a CNB-built image. This command returns information about the base images and buildpacks used to compose the OCI image.
```execute-2
pack inspect blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

You can add a `--bom` ("bill of materials") flag to get more detailed information about the contents of the image, including - in this case - versions of the JRE and of all of the Java dependencies.
```execute-2
pack inspect blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT --bom
```

You can also inspect the images using a tool called `dive`. 

```execute-1
dive blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

After running the command above use your keyboard to type: `Tab`, `Ctrl-U`, `Tab`
  
 The `Tab` button is used to switch between the Layer and Filetree views.
 `Ctrl-U` is used in the Filetree view to hide/show unmodified files.

 
Use the down arrow to move down the list of layers on the left-side window until you find the layers that have the dependencies (.jar files) and the app code (.class, .yml, etc files) on the right hand side.

> Picture for reference of dependencies:
![alt_text](images/dive-cnb-libs.png "find workspace after tab, ctrl-u, tab")


> Picture for reference of application-specific files:
![alt_text](images/dive-cnb-classes.png "find workspace after tab, ctrl-u, tab")

Notice that there is no single fat jar. Rather, the Java application was exploded. 
This is an optimization to achieve faster startup time. 
Notice also that the exploded files are organized into multiple layers, separating files that change infrequently (e.g. Spring Boot base libraries) from files that change more frequently (e.g. your code). 
The layer that is most likely to change (application-specific .class files) is now kilobytes rather than megabytes.
This makes it faster to rebuild images and publish images updates to container registries. 

The precise intelligence for building the OCI image, including the optimizations above as well as others, don't come from the CNB project itself. 
Rather, they come from the set of Buildpacks that Spring Boot is using by default. 
These are the paketo Buildpacks. 
You can learn more about the Paketo Java Buildpack [here](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/java).

Exit `dive`.
```execute-1
<ctrl+c>
```

Build images for the remaining Color Application services. 
```execute-1
cd authgateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
cd blueorgreenfrontend && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
cd blueorgreengateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ..
```

When the above commands have completed, list the images in your local Docker daemon.
```execute-1
docker images | grep SNAPSHOT
```

Your output should look like this.
```
blueorgreengateway         0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   8ead496cabe7   41 years ago   320MB
authgateway                0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   ff9d3de874f1   41 years ago   321MB
blueorgreen                0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   cf9a8a4ece64   41 years ago   317MB
blueorgreenfrontend        0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   d33a31edb7e6   41 years ago   317MB
```

## Publish images to registry

In order to deploy these images to Kubernetes, Kubernetes must be able to "pull" them. 
Kubernetes cannot access them from the local Docker daemon. 
It can, however, pull them from a container registry that is network-accessible.

A local private container registry is available in this workshop environment.
For convenience, its address is saved in an environment variable. 
You can see it by running the following command.
```execute-1
echo $REGISTRY_HOST
```

Publish the images to the container registry.
```execute-1
docker tag blueorgreen:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice

docker tag blueorgreenfrontend:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend

docker tag blueorgreengateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway

docker tag authgateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
```

## Validate that the containers are in the registry
```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice
```

```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
```

```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway
```

```execute-1
skopeo list-tags docker://$REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
```
